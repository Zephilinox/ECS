ECS
===

Entity Component System for C++/SFML

This was written a long time ago, before there were better public ECS libraries out there like Entt. This might be a useful learning resource for a basic ECS, but keep in mind it lacks a lot of the benefits of an ECS due to lack of cache coherency and that I wrote it 6 years ago (as of 2019) when I was a much worse programmer, as can be seen in my use of std::shared_ptr
